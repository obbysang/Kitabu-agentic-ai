Cronos x402 Paytech Hackathon
The Cronos x402 Paytech Hackathon invites builders from around the world to create the next generation of agentic, on-chain and AI-powered applications. This hackathon focuses on the emerging frontier of AI agents, x402-style programmatic payments and AI-native on-chain infrastructure enabled by Cronos EVM and the Crypto.com ecosystem.

Whether you're building agentic payment flows, AI-enhanced wallets, Crypto.com-integrated settlement tools, RWA rails, data virtualization layers, or new developer tooling for x402 agents, this is your chance to shape the future of AI-powered payments on-chain.

On-Chain Component: Must interact with Cronos EVM and x402-compatible flows
GitHub Repository via Dorahacks platform
Demo Video showcasing the prototype
Functional Prototype deployed on Cronos EVM Testnet or Mainnet
Multiple Tracks:

Projects may submit to multiple tracks if they meet the criteria.

Tracks
1. Main Track — x402 Applications (Broad Use Cases)
The primary track for builders exploring AI agents using x402 for novel, intelligent or automated on-chain actions. Examples:

agent-triggered payments
AI-driven contract interactions
dynamic asset management
automated treasury or routing logic
RWA settlement and lifecycle automation
consumer apps with embedded x402 flows
2. x402 Agentic Finance/Payment Track  — Advanced Programmatic Settlement & Workflows
A specialised track for financially complex, multi-step x402 automation. Examples:

automated settlement pipelines
multi-leg transactions and batching
risk-managed agentic portfolios
institutional-grade workflow automation
recurring or conditional instruction sets
3. Crypto.com X Cronos Ecosystem Integrations
For teams building solutions that connect Crypto.com’s ecosystem with Cronos, especially when paired with x402-driven settlement rails. Examples:

Crypto.com on-chain wallet integrations – connecting user balances, payment flows or settlement logic to Cronos via x402.
Crypto.com Market Data MCP Server integrations [https://mcp.crypto.com/docs]  - Connect real-time cryptocurrency market data directly to your AI assistant. Get instant access to prices, market trends and trading information in ChatGPT and Claude.
Crypto.com AI agent SDK integrations on Cronos EVM - embedding AI-driven automation directly into dApps, services, or payment surfaces built on Cronos.
Cronos dApp integrations, such as:
Moonlander (Perpetuals Trading) – automated trade execution, agent-triggered strategies and x402-powered settlement workflows.
Delphi (Prediction Markets) – AI-assisted market participation, automated prediction execution and agentic settlement routing.
VVS Finance (DEX) – intelligent swap routing, automated liquidity actions, or agent-driven trade workflows using x402.
4. Dev Tooling & Data Virtualization Track
Infrastructure enabling AI agents and/or x402 applications to be built, tested and scaled. Examples:

agent runtimes and orchestration
MCP-compatible developer tools
data virtualization / unified data layers
indexing, search and agent-readable feeds
debugging, monitoring & observability for agentic transactions
Project Evaluation
At the end of the build phase, all submissions will be evaluated by the judging panel from Cronos Labs.

Evaluation focuses on:

Innovation
Agentic functionality
Execution quality
Potential ecosystem value
Judges Panel:

Leslie Cheung, Head of DevRel, Cronos Labs
Edward Adlard, Head of Ecosystem, Cronos Labs
Tommy Chan, Head of DeFi Investment, Crypto.com
Steve Ngok, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), DoraHacks
